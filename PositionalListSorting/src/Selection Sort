Selection Sort: The PosListSelectionSorter class's sort() methods are to be based upon this algorithm:

current_cursor = front of list;
// loop invariant:
//   The nodes in the portion of the list preceding current_cursor
//   are in ascending order and have values <= all the nodes that follow

while (current position is not the rear) {
   find the node between current_cursor and the rear having min value;
   
   swap contents of that node with the node at current_cursor;
   
   advance current_cursor to next position;
}
